# Nomans' World

Hello and welcome to my attempt at making an RPG game engine on Discord using Discord.py



## Project Goals:

- Create a system independent tool for storytelling and rpg/ttrpg games on discord. 
- Modular in design to allow for easy addition of new features. 
- A User Interface robust enough that players never needs to use text commands.
- Dev tools to make using this to tell your story an easy process.


### Things Made:

- Storyboard. Combining image and text info into a single image then posting along with buttons. Allowing users to experience anything from NPC conversations to branching path mini-adventures. 
- Cartographer. Using data writen to a JSON file, the bot will create a category and text channels populated with location descriptions and NPC/Mission trigger buttons. 
- Storyboard_Builder. Tkinter based tool for writing JSON needed for the Storyboard (works but...) 

### TODO:

- Storyboard_Builder. Total rewrite, what is up now was good Tkinter practice but needs to be remade.
- Quartermaster. A way to display the inventory of players and shops, as well as a way to buy and sell items. 
- Field_Marshal. A simple combat system that is made for quick encounters. Not ment to replace normal game combat.
- Player_Menu. A system so players can access things such as their stats, quest log, items and other stuff.
